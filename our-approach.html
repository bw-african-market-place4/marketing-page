                <h2>The Challenge</h2>
                <p>Informal cross-border trade is a major feature of African economies: it creates jobs, contributes to food and energy security, and alleviates poverty. However many traders are unaware of their rights, required customs procedures and documentation, making them vulnerable to corruption and harassment.</p>

                    <h4>Anonymous Reporting for Border Crossings</h4>
                    <p>Through our anonymous reporting mechanism we crowd-source data to map incidents of harassment and corruption at border crossings across East Africa.</p>

                    <h4>Driving Advocacy and Partnerships</h4>
                    <p>Traders can use our number to find out what documentation, taxes and tariffs are applicable to their products, and receive regular updates on changes to border procedures.</p>

                    <h4>Empowering Africa's Cross-Border Traders with the Right Information</h4>
                    <p>We work with civil society organisations to use data collected through our platform for evidence-based advocacy at community, national and regional levels.</p>
